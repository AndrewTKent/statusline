Five tools, one repo, shared data files:

- **Claude Code statusline** (`bin/statusline.sh`) — the multi-line dashboard below
- **Codex statusline** (`bin/codex-statusline`, `codex-top`) — the same idea for the Codex CLI
- **`accounts`** (`bin/accounts.py`) — native-profile account routing and headroom board
- **Token scanning & redaction** (`bin/scan-tokens*`) — attribute every token, redact before sharing
- **Agent Metrics** (`bin/agent-metrics`) — opt-in local telemetry and dashboard

Everything you need to not get rate-limited, blow your budget, or lose context mid-task. The Claude statusline is one bash script, zero dependencies beyond `jq`.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewTKent/statusline/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or via npm:
```bash
npx @andrewkent/claude-statusline install
```

Or manually — copy the script, add one key to settings:
```bash
cp bin/statusline.sh ~/.claude/statusline.sh && chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline.sh
```
```json
{ "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh", "padding": 0, "refreshInterval": 60 } }
```

Restart Claude Code. Done.

**Requires:** [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) &middot; Claude Code (logged in) &middot; Optional: [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) for PR badges

### Codex

**Requires:** Codex CLI &middot; Python 3 &middot; `~/.local/bin` on `PATH` &middot; Multi-line statusline (default): `tmux` &middot; Optional: [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) for PR linkage

```bash
./install-codex.sh
codex-statusline
codex-statusline --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request
```

The default launcher uses a fixed bottom pane matching the multi-line Claude
Code status view. It shows the current model, elapsed time, routed account,
repository and branch, context use, local tokens consumed, purchased credits,
permissions, and each registered Codex account's weekly quota and reset time.
Codex does not expose a fixed token balance
for subscription limits; the footer reports exact quota percentage remaining
instead of inventing a token estimate. It binds each
footer to the rollout file opened by its owning Codex process, so concurrent and
resumed sessions do not exchange context values. The renderer always occupies
up to 14 rows by default, so changing session data cannot move the composer. Tmux mouse handling
is disabled so the terminal owns ordinary drag selection and copy/paste. Pane
scrollback keeps a 100,000-line history; tune it with
`CODEX_STATUSLINE_HISTORY_LIMIT`. When launched inside an existing
tmux pane, that pane keeps the history depth it was created with; the session
`mouse` and window `history-limit` options are restored when the launcher exits.
When launched outside tmux, detaching (prefix d) leaves Codex running — reattach with
`tmux attach -t codex-statusline-<pid>`; the session ends when Codex exits.

Set `CODEX_STATUSLINE_NATIVE=1` for Codex's compact one-row footer and
`--no-alt-screen`. Native mode preserves normal terminal scrollback but cannot
show account, elapsed time, daily or lifetime tokens, linked agents, or the
Claude Code-style multi-row layout.

The footer refreshes every 3s (`CODEX_STATUSLINE_INTERVAL`) and backs off to a
30s poll once its session has been idle for 10 minutes, exits when the owning
process is gone, and opportunistically truncates the state DB's WAL when it
grows past 128 MB — long-lived footers previously starved SQLite checkpoints
until every Codex query slowed to a crawl.

The launcher defaults to Codex YOLO mode by passing
`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. An explicit `-a/--ask-for-approval`,
`-s/--sandbox`, or dangerous-bypass flag replaces that default; profile (`-p`) or
`-c` approval overrides do not. Set
`CODEX_STATUSLINE_MANAGE_APPROVALS=0` to pass no permission default. In multi-line
mode, `tui.status_line=[]` keeps only Codex's compact built-in prompt footer while
the detailed dashboard stays in the fixed pane.
Settings load from `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/statusline.conf`; non-empty environment
variables override file values, and `CODEX_STATUSLINE_CONFIG` points at a
different file.

`codex-top` is the live fleet view for parent and subagent sessions. Both views
read the newest `~/.codex/state_N.sqlite` and rollout JSONL files locally; neither
calls an API. Use `codex-watch --details` for expanded session details or
`codex-statusline --json` for a machine-readable snapshot (renderer-only first flags
dispatch to the renderer; anything else launches Codex). `codex-top` monitors existing sessions.

### Agent Metrics (optional)

Agent Metrics is an opt-in, local-first history and dashboard add-on for Claude
Code and Codex. It is not installed or started by either default installer.
Nothing is collected until one of its explicit commands is run. It requires
Python 3.11 or newer; set `AGENT_METRICS_PYTHON` to a compatible interpreter
when the system `python3` is older.

```bash
bin/agent-metrics init
bin/agent-metrics sync --max-lines 5000
bin/agent-metrics watch --interval 60 --max-lines 5000
bin/agent-metrics serve
# In another terminal, only when you want a browser window:
bin/agent-metrics open
```

`init` creates private runtime storage and a configuration file. On macOS the
default is `~/Library/Application Support/statusline/agent-metrics/`; on Linux
it is `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/statusline/agent-metrics/`. Override it
with `--data-dir` or `AGENT_METRICS_DATA_DIR`. Runtime data is never written to
this repository.

`sync` incrementally scans local Claude Code and Codex JSONL files into raw,
event-level SQLite rows and rebuilds derived one-minute metrics. Repeated scans
are idempotent. `--max-lines` bounds one invocation; omit it for an unlimited
manual backfill. Bounded scans reserve capacity for appended live files and for
both providers while rotating through older sources by salted source ID.
`watch` is an explicit foreground loop that defaults to 5,000 lines every 60
seconds, measured after each completed cycle. It prints live/backfill progress
and remaining file/byte counts; Ctrl-C stops it cleanly. With
`AGENT_METRICS_RECORDER=1` in `statusline.conf`, `macos/launchd/install-agents.sh`
keeps `watch` running as a launchd agent (`com.claude-agent-metrics-watch`) in
place of the token scanner; otherwise nothing autostarts it. The local dashboard polls that database for a stacked token
timeline with selectable token series, one-minute raw or trailing moving-average views, a trailing-day hourly/cumulative view, provider/account/model/effort/session/agent filters, account and model
totals, parent/child agent drilldown, compactions, tool outcomes and durations,
turn latency, quota snapshots, and explicitly exposed cost. `serve` does not
scan automatically and binds only to a loopback address; non-loopback binds are
rejected. Its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have no network dependencies or
analytics.
`open` passes a private local capability to the browser; dashboard API reads
without that capability are rejected, including requests from other local processes.

The database stores numerical metadata plus provider, model, effort, opaque
session/request/call IDs, and tool names/statuses. It never stores prompts,
transcript text, tool arguments or output, source text, source paths,
credentials, token values, emails, or account-holder names. Account and source
identities use a local salt. Claude attribution matches each event timestamp to
`session-accounts.json` using half-open `[from,to)` spans; the organization ID
participates in the account hash. Codex reads only the explicit current
`account_id` field from `auth.json`; it never decodes or stores access, refresh,
or identity tokens.

Configuration lives in the runtime directory's `config.toml`; the generic
template is [`config/agent-metrics.toml.example`](config/agent-metrics.toml.example).
Source paths, account aliases, pricing metadata, retention, bind address, and
port are configurable. Agent Metrics can reuse declared short Claude account
labels from `ACCOUNT_LABELS` in a configurable `statusline.conf`; explicit
`[account_aliases]` entries win, and the feature can be disabled. Patterns,
emails, and organization IDs are matched only in memory and are never stored.
Pricing is not applied to infer event cost.

Optional `[account_tiers]` entries map declared account labels to `5x` or
`20x`. Agent Metrics records minute quota observations from the shared account
snapshot and incrementally backfills the existing Claude utilization history
when a declared label matches in memory. It excludes stale, pending-reset,
reset-crossing, and zero/negative-utilization intervals, then compares tracked
token deltas with positive five-hour utilization deltas by plan cohort, model,
and reasoning effort. The dashboard reports samples, dispersion, and observed
token ranges as a **tracked-token equivalent**. This is empirical local data,
not an Anthropic-published fixed quota; other clients and untracked usage can
bias it. For accounts without safe declared-label history, inference starts
with new shared snapshots.

Current capture limits: Codex local history does not expose historical account
handoffs, so newly ingested Codex rows receive the account active at their first
sync. Some Claude records omit reasoning effort, context limits, compaction
details, quota, or cost; those fields remain empty rather than being inferred.
Tool duration is available only when matching start/end records are present.

## What You See

`default` renders one labeled row per fact — the block at the top of this README. Every row below `repo` is conditional on data actually being available:

| Row | Shown when | What it shows |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| `model` | always | Model + effort (`· low`/`· medium`/`· high`/`· xhigh`/`· max`/`· ultracode`) + `⚡fast` when Settings' fast mode is on |
| `time` | session duration available | Wall-clock (`⏱ 24:12`); adds `idle Nm` after 30s with no user turn |
| `account` | account resolved | Tag from `ACCOUNT_LABELS`, colored per `LABEL_COLORS` |
| `repo` | always | Primary repository name |
| `tree` | the checkout is a linked worktree | Worktree name |
| `branch` | the checkout is in Git | Branch, dirty `*`, and `↑`/`↓` divergence |
| `pr` | the checkout maps to an open PR | PR number and title for the checked-out branch or detached PR head |
| `context` | always | Context-window fill — 15-dot sweet-spot bar (blue <30%, green 30–70%, yellow 70–85%, red 85%+) |
| `session` | 5h rate-limit data available | 5h window used, 15-dot bar + `resets <time>` |
| `weekly` | 7-day rate-limit data available | 7-day window used, 15-dot bar + `resets <date>` |
| `fable` | account has a per-model weekly cap | That cap's usage, 15-dot bar (label = the scoped model; opt-out `SHOW_FABLE_ROW=0`) |
| `budget` | `DAILY_BUDGET` set | Spend vs. cap, 10-dot bar |
| `tokens` | scan data available | All-time work/personal token ratio, 10-dot bar (opt-out `SHOW_TOKENS_ROW=0`) |
| goal row | `CHALLENGE_GOAL_M` set (see script header comment) | Progress toward a token goal, labeled `CHALLENGE_LABEL` (opt-out `SHOW_CHALLENGE_ROW=0`) |
| `bounty` | bounty config set and uncleared | ETA to a work-token floor (opt-out `SHOW_BOUNTY_ROW=0`) |
| `usage` | scan data available | Today / this session / lifetime totals, human-formatted |
| `stack` | `SHOW_BACKENDS_ROW=1` | Live snapshot across Claude/Codex/remote agents (`bin/live-state.py`) |
| per-account rows | `SHOW_ACCOUNT_RESETS=1` | One row per tracked account: 5h%, reset, week%, fable%, reset, work-unit cap |

PR badge states: `[draft]`, `[PR✗]` checks failing, `[PR△]` changes requested, `[PR✓]` approved, `[PR⋯]` checks pending, `[PR]` open with no strong signal either way.

### Token tracking

`tokens` and `usage` are both fed by `bin/scan-tokens.py`'s background scan of every session JSONL, cached to `~/.claude/token-scan-summary.json` (small, preferred) or `~/.claude/token-scan-cache.json` (full, fallback) — rescanned in the background whenever that cache is older than 180s.

- **`tokens`** — all-time work/personal ratio (cyan = work, magenta = personal), classified per-request by the `WORK_PATHS`/`WORK_KEYWORDS` vs `PERSONAL_PATHS`/`PERSONAL_KEYWORDS` rules in `statusline.conf`
- **`usage`** — today / this session / lifetime, human-formatted (k/M/B)
- Subagent (Agent tool) tokens are scanned separately (30s cache) and only break out in the optional token-goal row

### Account tagging

All cost and token ledgers are tagged with your account label (e.g., `work` or `personal`), derived from your OAuth email via `ACCOUNT_LABELS`. This lets you aggregate spend by account after the fact. Two related but distinct dimensions live inside the token scanner itself: `EMAIL_PAYER_MAP` (which plan paid) and the work/personal path/keyword classifier (what the work was) — see Configure.

Set `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT=1` to make account and quota rendering read-only and snapshot-only. Run `accounts poll` for one refresh or `accounts watch --interval 60` as an explicit foreground loop. The renderer reads `~/.accounts/statusline-snapshot.json` once, maps the current account only through `ACCOUNTS_ROUTED_LABEL`, and displays only declared short labels. It does not inspect credentials, call the profile or usage APIs, write shared ledgers, or start the full token scanner. Missing, stale, pending-reset, and error data remain unknown or visibly stale; they are never rendered as zero. `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT_FILE` and `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE` are configurable.

Shared mode uses its own lightweight presentation: the default layout keeps the
account board, while compact terminal formats use one line. It still refreshes
the terminal title and router state, but skips legacy notifications and history writes.

Claude Code's `statusLine.refreshInterval` controls renderer cadence. A 60-second interval matches the foreground account watcher and avoids repeated work for minute-resolution quota data.

### Terminal tab titles

The script sets the terminal tab title (via ANSI escape) to `repo-name` on main/master, or `repo-name (branch)` on feature branches. Useful in Zed, iTerm2, and other terminals to tell sessions apart at a glance.

### Background — Notifications

macOS Notification Center alerts are off by default; opt in with
`STATUSLINE_NOTIFY=1` (exported, or set in `~/.claude/statusline.conf`).
When enabled they fire once per threshold, deduped:
- **Rate limit** at 80%, 90%, 95%
- **Context** at 80%, 95%
- **Budget** at 90%, 100%

### Automatic account detection

When you `/login` inside a routed profile, the status bar detects the credential change before writing its ledgers, refreshes the profile, and updates the rate limits and account label on the next render. Sessions using that same native profile see the refreshed login. If the login belongs to another stored account, the router repairs the current profile and pins the logged-in account at the active policy scope: pane-local for a pane pin, otherwise global.

---

## Formats

Seven render modes. Set `FORMAT=` in `~/.claude/statusline.conf` or `STATUSLINE_FORMAT=` env var.

### `default` — Multi-line dashboard (shown above)

The full cockpit, one labeled row per fact. Auto-falls-through to `narrow` when the detected terminal width is below `NARROW_THRESHOLD` (default 60 cols).

### `compact` — Context + session only

Just the `context` and `session` rows — the two numbers that actually gate you.

### `narrow` — Trimmed fallback for tight panels

Same facts as `default` (model+effort, dir+branch, context, 5h, 7d+cost), trimmed hard: short labels, 5–8 char bars scaled to `COLS`, no reset timestamps or breakdowns. Auto-selected under `default` when the panel is narrow; can also be set explicitly.

### `sigil` — Single dense line

```
◈ Opus 4.6 · $2.14 ($8.90/d) · ●●●○○ 60% · ⎇ feature-123✦↑1[PR✓] · 42%⏱24:12 · 71%w
```

Width-adaptive: full detail (cost, daily aggregate, context, git, 5h rate, weekly) at ≥120 cols; drops the daily aggregate and weekly at ≥80; drops git detail to a bare branch name and rate to a bare percentage below 80. Good for tmux status bars or small terminals.

### `sparkline` — Default + trend history

```
  ...default output...
  trend   cost▁▂▃▅▃▂▁▄▆█  rate▁▃▅▇█▇▅▃▂▁
```

Appends inline `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` mini-charts (cost and 5h-rate trend, last 15 sessions) read from `~/.claude/session-history.jsonl`. See if you're burning hotter today than yesterday.

### `rprompt` — Zsh right-prompt

Writes zsh-formatted status to `~/.claude/rprompt.txt`. Add to `.zshrc`:

```zsh
_claude_rprompt() {
  local f=~/.claude/rprompt.txt
  [[ -f "$f" ]] || return
  local age=$(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -f %m "$f") ))
  (( age > 300 )) && { RPROMPT=""; return }
  RPROMPT="$(cat "$f")"
}
autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook
add-zsh-hook precmd _claude_rprompt
```

Claude metrics in your shell prompt gutter. Zero vertical space. Auto-hides after 5 minutes of inactivity. Also emits `sigil` to stdout for Claude Code's own status area.

### `iterm2` — Native terminal status bar

Pushes structured data to iTerm2 via `OSC 1337;SetUserVar` or sets the Kitty window title via `OSC 2`. Auto-detects your terminal; also emits `sigil` to stdout as a fallback.

**iTerm2 setup:** Preferences → Profiles → Session → Status Bar → add "Interpolated String" components:

`\(user.claude_model)` &middot; `\(user.claude_cost)` &middot; `\(user.claude_ctx)` &middot; `\(user.claude_git)` &middot; `\(user.claude_rate)` &middot; `\(user.claude_timer)`

---

## Configure

Create `~/.claude/statusline.conf` (bash, sourced directly). Full annotated version with every knob: [`config/statusline.conf.example`](config/statusline.conf.example). All settings are optional — the script works with no config file at all.

**Cost & format**
- `DAILY_BUDGET=20` — daily cost ceiling; enables the `budget` row + 90%/100% notifications (when opted in)
- `STATUSLINE_NOTIFY=1` — opt in to macOS Notification Center threshold alerts (default off)
- `FORMAT=default` — `default | compact | narrow | sigil | sparkline | rprompt | iterm2`

**Branch display**
- `BRANCH_PREFIX_STRIP="andrew/"` — strip a literal prefix off the displayed branch name
- `MAX_BRANCH=24` — max visible branch chars before an ellipsis

**Account labels**
- `ACCOUNT_LABELS="work:*@company.com personal:me@gmail.com"` — email pattern → short tag, first match wins
- `LABEL_COLORS="work:cyan personal:magenta"` — tag → color for the `account` row (unmapped tags default to orange)
- `EMAIL_PAYER_MAP="work:you@company.com personal:me@gmail.com"` — which plan paid, for the token scanner's `payer` dimension (independent of the work/personal classifier below)
- `SHOW_ACCOUNT_RESETS=1` — adds a per-account board (5h%, reset, week%, fable%, reset, work-unit cap) below the main rows
- `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT=1` — read account/routing/quota rows only from the private accounts snapshot; use `accounts watch --interval 60` to refresh it explicitly
- `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT_FILE` / `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE` — override the snapshot path or stale threshold
- `ACCOUNTS_HARD_SESSION_LIMIT=1` — opt in to stopping routed Claude sessions at 100% five-hour utilization; account pins are bypassed only at that boundary

**Token classifier** (feeds the `tokens` row's work/personal split — see `bin/scan-tokens.py`)
- `WORK_PATHS` / `PERSONAL_PATHS` — comma-separated cwd/file-path substrings
- `WORK_KEYWORDS` / `PERSONAL_KEYWORDS` — comma-separated prompt keywords (weighted 3× a path hit)

**Bounty / challenge tracker** (opt-in token-goal ETA)
- `CHALLENGE_START`, `BOUNTY_TARGET_TOKENS`, `BOUNTY_LOOKBACK_DAYS`, `BOUNTY_SESSION_GAP_MIN`

**Row visibility** (each defaults on when its data exists; `0` hides it)
- `SHOW_FABLE_ROW`, `SHOW_TOKENS_ROW`, `SHOW_CHALLENGE_ROW`, `SHOW_BOUNTY_ROW`

**Live state stack row** (opt-in)
- `SHOW_BACKENDS_ROW=1` — adds a `stack` row from `bin/live-state.py`: a snapshot across Claude (`account-resets.json`), Codex (newest `state_N.sqlite`), and remote autobuild agents (`$AGENT_SESSIONS_PATH`)

---

## Accounts: Multi-Account Routing

`accounts` (`bin/accounts.py`) and `codex-accounts` (`bin/codex_accounts.py`)
provide per-session routing and headroom boards. Each Claude account gets a
native config under `~/.accounts/profiles/<label>`; each Codex account gets an
isolated `CODEX_HOME` under `~/.codex-accounts/profiles/<label>`.
Credentials and entitlement caches are isolated; projects, transcripts, settings,
skills, and plugins are shared. Interactive sessions remain first-party
subscription sessions instead of API-token sessions.

For shared statusline rendering, enable `SHARED_ACCOUNT_SNAPSHOT=1` in
`statusline.conf`. The router installer registers a launch agent that runs
`accounts poll` every minute; `accounts watch --interval 60` is the foreground
alternative.

Install the router from a local checkout:

```bash
./install-account-router.sh
```

The installer puts the Claude router wrapper at `~/.local/bin/claude`, keeps
native Claude binaries under `~/.local/share/claude/versions`, installs both
router toolsets under `~/.local/bin`, and prepends supervised launchers from
`~/.accounts/bin` and `~/.codex-accounts/bin` in new zsh sessions.

`ACCOUNTS_HARD_SESSION_LIMIT=1` is an opt-in overage guard. A supervised
session resumes on another safe account on the next supervisor check after
100% five-hour utilization is observed, or terminates when none is available.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|---------------|
| `accounts set <label>` | Force every supervised session onto `<label>` |
| `accounts pane set <label>` | Pin only the current terminal pane to `<label>` |
| `accounts pane clear` | Return the current pane to the global policy |
| `accounts auto` | Clear global and pane pins, then route supervised sessions to the freshest account |
| `accounts fable` | Switch live supervised sessions to Fable while headroom is available |
| `accounts status` | Mode + per-account 5h/7d/Fable headroom + ⚠login flags |
| `accounts poll` | Refresh dormant stored/native profiles, then poll every routable account |
| `accounts refresh [label]` | Refresh stale file-backed credentials without a browser |
| `accounts mint <label>` | Mint + vault a 1-year token for headless jobs |
| `accounts tokens` | List minted tokens and expiry |
| `accounts sync` | Converge the token vault with a second machine |
| `accounts pick-env` | Emit `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and account metadata |

Codex uses its own command because the two CLIs expose different auth and quota
interfaces:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|---------------|
| `codex-accounts register [label]` | Register the current authenticated Codex home |
| `codex-accounts login [label]` | Authenticate another ChatGPT account in an isolated home |
| `codex-accounts auto` | Route supervised sessions to the account with the most headroom |
| `codex-accounts set <label>` | Pin supervised sessions to one account |
| `codex-accounts status` | Show the mode and each account's quota windows |
| `codex-accounts poll` | Refresh quota through Codex app-server without an inference |
| `codex-accounts pick --poll` | Poll and print the account selected by the current policy |

Codex requires `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"` and this SessionStart hook:

```toml
[[hooks.SessionStart]]
command = "if [ -x \"$HOME/.local/bin/codex-account-session\" ]; then exec \"$HOME/.local/bin/codex-account-session\"; fi"
```

The hook binds each thread to its routed label so the statusline stays correct
when concurrent sessions use different accounts. Automatic handoffs require a
fresh weekly usage reading strictly above 80% and another account whose binding
usage is at least 15 points lower. Poll errors, missing or stale weekly readings,
and short-window usage alone do not trigger a handoff. A hard `codex-accounts set`
pin moves the thread on the next supervisor check.

Inside Claude Code, prefix these with `!` (for example,
`!accounts set acme-max`). Set `"respondToBashCommands": false` in
`~/.claude/settings.json` so the switch does not trigger an LLM response.

`claude-router.py` supervises interactive sessions. It reserves the selected
account, watches the active model's quota windows, and resumes the exact session
under another isolated profile before a window is exhausted. The shell never
regains control during a handoff. Changing to Fable mode also moves running
supervised sessions to Fable in place — except a session you explicitly put on
another model (a `--model` launch flag or a live `/model` switch), which stays
there until you switch back to `/model fable` or re-run `accounts fable`. If
every Fable-capable account is gated, the same session resumes on Opus using the
safest general-model account.
Minted long-lived tokens remain outside `~/.claude`
(`~/.accounts/vault.json`); archival copies only session JSONLs from
`~/.claude/projects`.

---

## Token Scanning and Redaction

Two independent tools, both built on the same session JSONLs.

**Token scanning** (`bin/scan_tokens_core.py` + the `bin/scan-tokens*.py`/`.sh` CLIs) attributes every request to work/personal and to a payer, incrementally, and feeds the `tokens`/`usage`/goal/`bounty` rows above plus the work-unit cap columns on the account board. `bin/derive-cap.py` fits those per-account caps from utilization history — it's a manual, unscheduled tool you re-run occasionally, not something cron or launchd calls. Full design, cache schema, and failure modes: [`bin/ARCHITECTURE.md`](bin/ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Durable ledger & archival** (`bin/usage-ledger.py`, `bin/archive-transcripts.sh`, `bin/vault-snapshot.sh`) keep a permanent per-day/per-model token ledger at `~/.claude/usage-ledger.json` and mirror Claude Code session JSONLs nightly — rows never pruned, survives transcript cleanup.

## macOS Native

Three companion apps that read the same data files — no extra API calls.

### Menu Bar App

<img width="24" height="24" alt="green dot" src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><circle cx='12' cy='12' r='8' fill='%2327ae60'/></svg>"> Color-coded icon: green = ok, yellow = rate limit 70%+, red = 90%+ or context critical.

Click for a SwiftUI popover with full dashboard.

```bash
cd macos/ClaudeMenuBar
./build.sh      # Compiles with swiftc — no Xcode needed
./install.sh    # Copies to ~/Applications, auto-starts at login
```

### Raycast Extension

Search "Claude Status" for a full metric list, or pin to menu bar for always-visible `$12.34 | 5hr: 45%`.

```
macos/claude-raycast/    # TypeScript — ready when Raycast is installed
```

### Widget Bridge

Consolidates all status data into `~/.claude/widget-snapshot.json` with a 24-hour cost sparkline. Foundation for WidgetKit desktop/lock screen widgets.

```bash
swift macos/claude-widget/Bridge/claude-widget-bridge.swift
```

Run on a 30s launchd timer for auto-refresh. See [`macos/claude-widget/README.md`](macos/claude-widget/README.md) for setup.

## How It Works

Claude Code pipes a JSON status blob into the script via stdin on every tool call. The script:

1. **Parses** model, cost, context, session metadata (single `jq` call)
2. **Detects** credential changes and validates changed profile identity before any account-tagged ledger write
3. **Resolves** the account label from the OAuth profile cache and updates the daily cost/token ledgers in `~/.claude/`
4. **Scans** subagent JSONL files for the current session (cached 30s) and reads `token-scan-summary.json` (fallback: `token-scan-cache.json`) for the work/personal token split — kicks off a background `scan-tokens.py` rescan when that cache is stale (>180s)
5. **Builds** the git/PR segment (branch, dirty, ahead/behind, `gh pr view` cached 90s) and the effort/fast-mode/focus badges
6. **Refreshes** rate limits and profile from Anthropic's OAuth API in the background (usage cached 60s, profile cached 5min)
7. **Interpolates** usage between polls — tracks velocity across consecutive API responses for smooth fractional percentages
8. **Builds** the budget row (if `DAILY_BUDGET` is set) and the optional multi-account reset board (if `SHOW_ACCOUNT_RESETS=1`)
9. **Sets** terminal tab title to repo + branch
10. **Checks** notification thresholds when `STATUSLINE_NOTIFY=1` (fires once per crossing, deduped)
11. **Renders** in your chosen format, falling back to `narrow` under `NARROW_THRESHOLD` columns

### Performance

| Concern | How it's handled |
|---------|-----------------|
| Network latency | Background refreshes; a changed credential can block up to 2s for identity validation |
| Concurrent sessions | Lock file with stale-PID detection (auto-cleanup at 30s) |
| Git dirty check | `git diff-index --quiet HEAD` (faster than `git status`) |
| PR status | Repository-scoped `gh` lookup cached 90s, background-refreshed |
| Ledger writes | Atomic (mktemp + mv) |
| Account switch | OAuth token hash + credential mtime tracking, synchronous identity validation before ledger writes |
| Subagent scan | File-based cache with 30s TTL, scoped to current session |
| Token bar | `jq` read from `token-scan-summary.json` (fallback: `token-scan-cache.json`); the actual JSONL rescan runs in the background via `scan-tokens.py`, never inline |
| Shared account snapshot | One stable inode+mtime read; no credential/profile/usage calls or shared-ledger writes |
